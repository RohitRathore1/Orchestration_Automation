# Server Implementation

- **Setup FastAPI Project**: Initialized a FastAPI project. This includes setting up a virtual environment, installing 
FastAPI and Uvicorn (ASGI server) via pip.

- **Load Data into Memory**: On server startup, loaded the key-value pairs from the provided data file into a Python 
dictionary. Considering the requirement to handle up to a million  key-value pairs, a dictionary should be efficient 
for in-memory storage given sufficient RAM.

- **API Endpoint**: Created a `GET` endpoint that takes a UUID as a parameter and returns the corresponding value if it 
exists in the loaded dictionary.

- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling to manage cases where the key does not exist or the provided key is not 
a valid UUID.

## Questions to Answer

> How much data can your server handle? How could you improve it so it can handle even larger datasets?

The capacity to handle data depends on various factors, including the server's hardware resources (CPU, memory), the 
efficiency of the code, database design, and the nature of the data being processed. FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities 
allow it to handle many concurrent connections efficiently, making it suitable for IO-bound tasks.

Improvements for Handling Larger Datasets:

- **Database Optimization**: Use indexing, partitioning, and optimized queries to reduce data access times.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Leverage FastAPI's asynchronous request handling to improve IO operations.
- **Data Sharding**: Divide large datasets into smaller, manageable chunks distributed across multiple databases or servers.

> How many milliseconds it takes for the client to get a response on average? How could you improve the latency?

Response time can vary widely depending on the request's complexity, server load, network latency, and the efficiency of 
the underlying code and database queries. Measuring average response time requires setting up monitoring and logging tools 
like Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack to collect and analyze request metrics.

Improvements for Reducing Latency:

- **Optimize Application Code**: Profile the application to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
- **Database Performance**: Ensure queries are efficient and the database is optimized for the workload.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use a CDN for static assets to reduce load times for users in different geographical 
    locations.
- **Concurrency Model**: Utilize FastAPI's asynchronous features to handle non-blocking operations more efficiently.

> What are some failure patterns that you can anticipate?

Several common failure patterns can affect web applications, including:

- **Database Connection Issues**: Overloaded databases or network issues can disrupt the application's ability to access data.
- **Memory Leaks**: Inefficient resource management can lead to memory leaks, degrading performance over time.
- **Dependency Failures**: External service dependencies (APIs, microservices) may become unavailable or slow, affecting your 
    application.
- **Traffic Spikes**: Sudden increases in traffic can overwhelm the server if not appropriately scaled to handle high loads.

Mitigation Strategies:

- **Implementing Circuit Breakers**: To prevent a failing service from affecting others.
- **Rate Limiting**: To control the number of requests a user can make in a certain period.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of active server instances based on the current load.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Ensure the application can gracefully handle errors and report them accurately.

## System Capacity and Improvements

- **Data Handling**: With up to a million key-value pairs, assuming an average size of 100 bytes per value, the dataset could 
require around 100MB of memory, which is manageable for modern servers. To handle larger datasets, techniques like sharding 
(distributing data across multiple servers) or using a memory-mapped file could be considered to avoid loading the entire 
dataset into RAM.

- **Latency Optimization**: The average response time could vary based on network latency, server load, and efficiency of the 
data lookup. To improve latency, we will have ensure the server is adequately provisioned and consider implementing caching mechanisms 
for frequently accessed keys. Profiling the application to identify bottlenecks and optimizing the code or infrastructure accordingly 
can also help.

- **Anticipated Failure Patterns**:

1. *Memory Limitation*: If the dataset grows beyond the server's RAM capacity, it could lead to performance degradation or crashes.
2. *High Load*: Under high request volumes, the server might become unresponsive. Implementing rate limiting or load balancing could 
mitigate this.
3. *Data File Corruption*: Ensure there's a mechanism to validate the integrity of the data file during server startup.

# Project Setup

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a 
number of additional packages. Using a virtual environment allows us to manage dependencies for our project without affecting the 
global Python installation.

First, navigate to our project's directory in the terminal, then run:

```bash
# For Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
```

This command creates a virtual environment named `venv` in our project directory.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
Before installing packages, we need to activate the virtual environment

# Key-Value Store API Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the API provided by the Key-Value Store application. This API allows clients to interact with a 
simple key-value store, supporting operations to retrieve and manage key-value pairs.

## Base URL

The base URL for accessing the API will depend on where the application is hosted. For local development, it's typically:

```
http://localhost:8000
```
